As a user,
   when I visit Word Watch
   I should see the top used word and its count (based on the Word Watch API database)
  in the "Top Word: " heading.
  e.g., "Top Word: ciabatta (22)"

import { expect } from "chai"
import sinon from "sinon"

describe("Word watch functions", () => {
  describe("", () => {
    it("", () => {
    })
  })
})
